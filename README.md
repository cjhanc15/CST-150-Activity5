# FileStats

## Summary:
1. I learned a lot of methods that I have never used before. One of the most helpful methods was .OrderBy(), which is how I was able to get my file data into alphabetical order. Something I also decided to learn for this was how to let the user choose their own filename. Using String interpolation, a variable can be placed inside of a string.

2. The biggest challenge was learning how to use the openFileDialog. Once I figured that out, everything was smooth sailing from there. I have used fileWrite and fileRead in other languages before, but creating it on an actual user interface was a challenge and new experience.

## How To Use:
1. Click the upload button and upload a .txt file
